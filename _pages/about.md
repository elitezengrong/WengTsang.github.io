I am currently a master student in the [School of Computer Science and Enginnering](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/) at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Xu Chen](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/node/2497). My research interest includes DL, LLM, ML, and distributed system.

My Undergraduate Study
======
I received the B.E. degree in the [School of Electronics and Communication Engineering](https://sece.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). My undergraduate major is Communication Engineering, with a focus on signal processing in the field of communications. During my undergraduate studies, I had the honor of being mentored by [Prof. Kechao Cai](https://sece.sysu.edu.cn/szll/js/rztx/1389939.htm) and [Prof. Yifeng Wu](https://sece.sysu.edu.cn/szll/js/zngz/1384617.htm). I also felt delighted to research with Jiaxian Xu and [Yuheng Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w3jxo7wAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) during my undergraduate studies.
